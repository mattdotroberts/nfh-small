<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjgldht4PKw">It’s Friday then, it’s Saturday, Sunday …</a></p><p>Happy almost-the-weekend everyone. Have had a couple of nice notes from dads-to-be and dads-just-started over the past few weeks, talking about how happy they are to find this resource and community just as they’re starting out on their fatherhood journey. </p><p>I wanted to use this weekend’s discussion to allow those of us with a few more years experience to impart some wisdom. <strong>What’s the best piece of advice you have for new fathers? </strong>I’ll throw mine down in the comments below, and then let all those new dads know yours. </p><p>If you can’t think of your own, please share the best piece that someone else gave to you!</p>
